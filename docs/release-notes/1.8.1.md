Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

## Release Highlights

* [PBM-871](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-871) - Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster. Now the UUID of users and system collections are not preserved when replaying the oplog. 
* [PBM-881](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-881) - The point-in-time recovery chunks display is now consistent in both ``pbm status`` and ``pbm list`` outputs.
