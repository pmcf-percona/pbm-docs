# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.3.0 (2023-09-25)

[Installation](../installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* The support for MongoDB 4.2 is deprecated. Existing functionality in Percona Backup for MongoDB remains compatible with MongoDB 4.2 and Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2; however, further enhancements and bug fixes are no longer tested against this version.
* The ability to [view the backup contents](../usage/describe-backup.md) improves troubleshooting of backups in environments where databases are often created and / or dropped. 
* The ability to [make physical backups in mixed deployments](../features/physical.md#physical-backups-in-mixed-deployments) with MongoDB Community and Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB) nodes streamlines the backup flow for organizations that are still evaluating or migrating their data sets against PSMDB.
* Improved validation of a base backup snapshot for point-in-time recovery aligns the recovery flow for logical and physical backups.

### Supported platforms changes

* A Docker image for Percona Backup for MongoDB is now available for ARM64 architectures. This improves the user experience with PBM for developers with ARM-based MacBooks.
* Percona Backup for MongoDB packages are now available for Debian 12 (bookworm). Percona Server for MongoDB is adding support for Debian 12 with the 7.0.x version.
