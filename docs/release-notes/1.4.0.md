|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time.

## New Features

* [PBM-345](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-345): Centralize logs

* [PBM-435](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-435): `pbm status` command

## Improvements

* [PBM-572](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-572): Change backup ‘name’ in ‘pbm list’ etc to be consistent time (~= end time) rather than start time

* [PBM-556](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-556): Introduce operation ID

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-595](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-595): Shard backup with different rset name

* [PBM-604](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-604): Compression flag for ‘pbm list’ command doesn’t change the output

* [PBM-602](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-602): Empty PITR files are created on storage if PBM fails to upload oplog chunk due to insufficient range

* [PBM-597](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-597): Properly handle mongo fail while PITR slicing is enabled
