Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

This release fixes the usability issues for applications operating with Percona Backup for MongoDB by providing the error messages for the status output in the JSON format ([PBM-988](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-988)). It also includes the fix for the security vulnerability issue [CVE-2022-32149](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32149).
