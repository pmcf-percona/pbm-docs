# Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.7.0 (2022-04-18)

| Release date | April 18, 2022  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release highlights

* Support for physical backups in Percona Server for MongoDB starting from versions 4.2.15-16 and 4.4.6-8 and higher. Physical backups drastically speed up backup and restore performance for large databases (several terabytes). This is a technical preview feature .

* Oplog replay from the arbitrary start time. This reduces Recovery Point Objective (RPO) when database is recovered from physical or storage-level backups.

* Ability to configure compression method and level for Point-in-Time Recovery chunks and compression level for backups.

* Ability to configure the number of S3 multipart upload chunks to comply with various S3-compatible storage provider requirements.

* Ability to configure the number of upload retries. This facilitates data upload in case of unstable network connection.

## New Features

* [PBM-734](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-734): Add the config option to set debug log levels for S3  requests

* [PBM-805](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-805): Implement physical backups to improve performance for large databases

* [PBM-742](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-742): Add the ability to replay oplog from arbitrary start time. This reduces Recovery Point Objective (RPO) when database is recovered from physical backups.

## Improvements

* [PBM-680](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-680): Skip TLS verification for object storage. This can be useful for private object storage with self-signed certificates.

* [PBM-770](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-770): Support configurable compression method / level for Point-in-Time Recovery chunks (Thanks to Damiano Albani for reporting this issue and contributing to it)

* [PBM-764](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-764): Support Zstandard compression format (Thanks to Damiano Albani for reporting this issue and contributing to it)

* [PBM-750](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-750): Make max number of S3 upload parts configurable (Thanks to Damiano Albani for reporting this issue and contributing to it)

* [PBM-777](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-777): Expand / fix the configuration API to support compression method for Point-in-Time Recovery chunks (Thanks to Damiano Albani for reporting and contributing to this issue)

* [PBM-756](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-756): Add the ability to configure logging levels for S3 requests to debug issues with object storage (Thanks to Damiano Albani for reporting this issue and contributing to it)

* [PBM-577](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-577): It is now possible to choose an S3 storage class for granular control over various S3 tiers (Thanks to Damiano Albani for the contribution)

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-721](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-721): Fixed a bug where an upload of the backup to S3-storage was failing due to unstable network connection. Percona Backup for MongoDB can now be configured to retry the upload with flexible timeouts.

* [PBM-773](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-773): Check distributed transactions on all participating shards to avoid commit timestamp inconsistency upon restore
