# Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.1.1

| Release date | January 31, 2020  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent
backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for
restoring those backups to a specific point in time. The project was inspired by
(and intends to replace) the Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup tool.

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb)
or [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) version 3.6 or higher with
[MongoDB replication](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/)
enabled. Binaries for the supported platforms as well as the tarball with source
code are available from the [Percona Backup for MongoDB download page](https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-backup-mongodb/). For more
information about Percona Backup for MongoDB and the installation steps, see the documentation.
