# Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.1.0

Percona is happy to announce the release of Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.1.0 on January 16, 2020.

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent
backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for
restoring those backups to a specific point in time. The project was inspired by
(and intends to replace) the Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup tool.

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb)
or [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) version 3.6 or higher with
[MongoDB replication](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/)
enabled. Binaries for the supported platforms as well as the tarball with source
code are available from the [Percona Backup for MongoDB download page](https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-backup-mongodb/). For more
information about Percona Backup for MongoDB and the installation steps, see the documentation.

Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.1.0 introduces the new `pbm config` command to enable configuring
the store from the command line in addition to the configuration file. This
command effectively replaces pbm store which was only able to read store
configuration from the configuration file.

```
$ pbm config --set storage.s3.bucket="operator-testing"
```

## New Features

* [PBM-344](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-344): New pbm config command to support configuring the store
from the command line.

## Improvements

* [PBM-361](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-361): Improved the processing of timestamps when using oplog.

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-214](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-214): `pbm-agent` could crash with restore command running
forever, if the primary node became unavailable during the restore operation.

* [PBM-279](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-279): `pbm-agent` could be started with an invalid config file.

* [PBM-338](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-338): Backups that failed could appear in the output of the pbm
list command.

* [PBM-362](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-362): The `pbm backup` could fail when called from the primary
node if there were no healthy secondaries.

* [PBM-369](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-369): ReplicaSets could not establish connections when TLS was
used in the cluster.
