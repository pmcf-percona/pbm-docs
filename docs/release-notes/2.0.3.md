# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.3 (2023-01-11)

| Release date | January 11, 2023  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* [Incremental physical backups](../features/incremental-backup.md) enable you to reduce storage costs and facilitate data safety for business crucial data. By saving only the differences results in faster completion time and makes IB much smaller in size compared to full backups. As such, you save on storage space and data transfer in case of cloud setups. This is the [technical preview feature](../reference/glossary.md#technical-preview-feature), yet we welcome your feedback to improve the functionality.
* Now you can selectively back up and restore unsharded collections in sharded clusters. This extends the data set to work with.
* Added support of AWS IRSA (Identity Roles for Service Accounts) credentials allows Percona Backup for MongoDB running in a pod to access the AWS storage using the IAM roles. This increases the security of your cloud infrastructure and enables you to control the access to it from a single place.
* Percona Backup for MongoDB is now available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible derivatives
