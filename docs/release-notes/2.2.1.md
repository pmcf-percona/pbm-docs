# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.2.1 (2023-07-27)

| Release date | July 27, 2023  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

With this release you can increase the wait time for backup to start, thus eliminating the PBM failure when creating `$backupCursor` takes longer than usual.


## Improvements

* [PBM-1154](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1154) - Add config option to change wait timeout for backup start status

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-1151](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1151) - Fixed the issue with PBM crashing when Percona Server for MongoDB fails to open `$backupCursor`

* [PBM-1155](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1155) - Retry to open `$backupCursor` during incremental backups in case of failure
