# Percona Backup for MongoDB 0.5.0

Percona is pleased to announce the early release of Percona Backup for MongoDB 0.5.0 of our
latest software product on June 17, 2019. The GA version of Percona Backup for MongoDB is scheduled to
be released later in 2019.

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent
backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for
restoring those backups to a specific point in time. Percona Backup for MongoDB
uses a distributed client/server architecture to perform backup/restore
actions.

The project was inspired by (and intends to replace) the
[Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup tool](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup).

Percona Backup for MongoDB supports Percona Server for MongoDB or MongoDB Community Server version 3.6 or higher with
MongoDB replication enabled. Binaries for the supported platforms as well as
the tarball with source code are available from the [Percona Backup for MongoDB
download page](https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-backup-mongodb/LATEST/). For more
information about Percona Backup for MongoDB and the installation steps, see the [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb).

Percona Backup for MongoDB 0.5.0 features the following:

* Enables storing backup metadata on Amazon Simple Storage Service storages.

* The API of Percona Backup for MongoDB introduces HTTP basic authentication to prevent an
unauthorized user from running backups or restoring data if they manage to
access the API port.

* To optimize the usage of network resources, the pbm-agent on `mongos` is not
needed any more and backup-coordinator automatically establishes connection
to the appropriate `mongos` instance.

* The output of `pbmctl list nodes` now includes the replica set name and
informs the backup status of the node.

Percona doesn’t recommend this release for production as its API
and configuration fields are still likely to change. It only features
a basic API level security. Please report any bugs you encounter in
[our bug tracking system](https://jira.percona.com).
