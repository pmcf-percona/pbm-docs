Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

This release introduces the following fixes:

* for the physical restore process for deployments where the mongod `--dbpath` option has a forward slash ('/') as the last char
* security vulnerability [CVE-2022-41723](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41723) by updating the Golang library dependencies to the latest versions

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-1058](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1058) - Fixed the physical restore issue if the `--dbpath` option has a tailing slash.

* [PBM-1076](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-1076) - Update golang.org/x/net module due to CVE-2022-41723
