Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time.

## New Features

* [PBM-426](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-426): Add AWS KMS key encryption/decryption for S3 buckets

Config format

```yaml
storage:
  s3:
    serverSideEncryption:
      sseAlgorithm: "aws:kms"
      kmsKeyID: "........"
```
