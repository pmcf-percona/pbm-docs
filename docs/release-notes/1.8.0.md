# Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.0 (2022-06-09)

| Release date | June 9, 2022  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights


* Ability to restore data to a replica set with a different name and configuration. This extends the list of environments compatible for the restore.

* When you use EBS-snapshots or other tools for physical backups, you no longer have to create a mandatory base backup snapshot in |Percona Backup for MongoDB| as the starting point for Point-in-Time Recovery oplog slicing. This reduces time and effort on managing excessive backups and makes Point-in-Time Recovery from physical or storage-level backups more straightforward.

* The ability to wait for the backup operation to finish before doing further actions through the session lock. This simplifies the automation of operations with Percona Backup for MongoDB.

* Ability to define backup compression level and method in Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration.

* To simplify the Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration, the example configuration file is now included in the Percona Backup for MongoDB package.

* Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) is added to the list of [supported platforms](https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-support-lifecycle#mongodb)
