| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |


Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time.

## Improvements

* [PBM-586](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-586): Add a request timeout to the S3 downloader during the restore

* [PBM-584](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-584): Ignore shard configuration during the restore

## Bugs Fixed

* [PBM-555](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-555): Fix the ” error demultiplexing archive” error during restore by downloading backup from s3 storage in chunks

* [PBM-460](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-460): Restore fails with conflicting namespace destinations (Thanks to user pedroalb for reporting this issue)
