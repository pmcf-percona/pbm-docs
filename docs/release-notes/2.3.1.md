Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

* Added support for Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.
* The ability to define custom endpoints when using Microsoft Azure Blob Storage for backups
* Improved PBM Docker image to allow making physical backups with the shared `mongodb` data volume
* Updated Golang libraries that include fixes for the security vulnerability CVE-2023-39325.
