# Backup management via Percona Monitoring and Management

You can manage backups not only via the command line, but also via the web interface using [Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html). This way you don't have to manually run commands on multiple servers. Instead, you can schedule backups or run them on demand from a single place and also receive real-time monitoring alerts.

Check PMM documentation for the following guides:

* [How to configure PMM to monitor MongoDB](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/client/mongodb.html)
* [Backup management for MongoDB in PMM](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/get-started/backup/backup_mongo.html).
